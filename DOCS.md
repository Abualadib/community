# Record

To record, simply hit the **Record** button in the top right corner:

</p>

This will bring up a record dialog where you can choose which microphone you want to use:

</p>

When you're finished recording, hit the **STOP** button. You'll then get the ability to both *save* or *discard* your recording.

You can also check out this [YouTube video](https://youtu.be/rDIlR71omg4), which amongst other things goes through how to create a Scrimba screencast.

# Edit recording

Once you're fininshed recording, you can edit your timeline by clicking the **BRUSHUP** icon. Check [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-2sSBJusQfc) if you want to watch a walkthrough of the post processing feature:

</p>

This will bring up a timeline with audio waveforms, where you can do three different editations: cut, speedup sections or silence a section. You can also make a section loop so that you can hear through it, however this is for editation purposes only.

To edit a section, hold the shift button down, click on the timeline and then drag the cursor over the area you want to edit. Then you'll see a menu appear with the editing options.

# The console

You can log out to the console in Scrimba screencasts. To toggle the console, click the CONSOLE option in the left sidebar of the project.


# Import / Export

You can import and export between files using the `require()` function and theÂ `exports` object.

Exporting using `exports`:

# External JavaScript Libraries

To use external scripts, you can either link to a CDN via a script tag or use npm.

## Script tag

## npm

First click the npm icon in the top right corner. This will open up a dialog where you can specify which package you want to add.

<p align="center">

Import the package to a .js file using `import` or `require`:

# HTML and JS limitations

There are some limitations for what kind of HTML tags and JavaScript features you can use in a Scrimba screencast:

### `<canvas>`
Our DOM recorder does not record the content of a `<canvas>` tag, meaning the live preview window will be blank when a `<canvas>` screencast is replayed.

### `<select>`
You can use the `<select>` tag, however we only record when the select element changes selection, and not 

### `<input type="date">`
You can use this tag, but we won't record the date picker component, only when the value of the input field is changed.

### `<a>` 
You can create links between the HTML files in your project. However, external links won't result in anything.
 
### `alert()`, `prompt()` and `confirm()`
These function calls won't be recorded by the Scrimba recorder, so there is no point using them in a Scrimba screencast. We recommend you to use `console.log()` instead where that's possible.
