This will bring up a record dialog. Here you can choose if you want to record audio, and whether or not you want to broadcast live:

## Edit recording

Once you're fininshed recording, you can edit your timeline by clicking the scissor icon:

This will bring up a timeline with audio waveforms, where you can do two things: *collapse sections* and *cut the ending*.

### Collapse section

To collapse a section, click on where you want to start, and drag the cursor over the area you want to collapse. Then hover over the area and you'll see a **COLLAPSE** button appear.

### Cut ending

If you're marking the area at the end of the cast, you can also cut it completely away.

This will allow you to start your next recording from any given point.
