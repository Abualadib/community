Welcome to the community page for [Scrimba](https://scrimba.com/). This is where you can submit feedback, create issues and in general keep yourself updated on how we plan to build out the site.

## Feature requests

Feature requests are organised as issues, and listed after the number of votes [here.](https://github.com/scrimba/community/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3Afeature-request+sort%3Areactions-%2B1-desc) To vote for a feature, give it a :+1:. To submit a new feature request, simply create a [new issue](https://github.com/scrimba/community/issues/new) and give it the *feature-request* label.

This repo also contains our [Frequently Asked Questions](https://github.com/scrimba/community/blob/master/FAQ.md) and [Terms of Service](https://github.com/scrimba/community/blob/master/TERMS.md).

We're very interested in getting feedback, so don't hesitate if you have anything you'd like to tell us. You can also email us at hello@scrimba.com.
