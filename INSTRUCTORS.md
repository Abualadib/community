# Guide for instructors

This section is meant for people who create content on Scrimba. Here we've gathered all relevant information, and we'll update it regularly.

At Scrimba, we're very interested in getting more people to create content. We believe that there are thousands of talented but undiscovered coding teachers out there. We want to unlock their talent by giving them an easy to use platform for sharing their skills, and over time, allow them to make money teaching.

### How do I become a Scrimba instructor?
It's easy. Just start creating screencasts and publish them. Everybody can do this, and it's completely free. We've written guide on [how to create screencasts here.](https://medium.com/scrimba/how-to-create-a-scrimba-screencast-e5ca244bc531) 

Once you've recorded your screencast, you likely need to do some editing (unless you've made a perfect recording). You can easily edit your screencast (cut, silence & speed up sections) following [this guide.](https://github.com/scrimba/community/blob/master/DOCS.md#edit-recording)

If you create multiple screencasts on the same subject, you should gather them in a playlist. This way your users can binge watch them automatically, and you can send people a link directly to your playlist. To do this, click your profile icon in the navbar and choose *New playlist*. Once you've done this, you can add screencasts to the playlist by clicking the settings icon in a screencast's thumbnail and whoosing *Add to playlist*. 

### Can I monetize my content?
We're going to allow content creators to monetize their content in the near future. If you're interested in creating paid courses on Scrimba, send us an email at hello@scrimba.com with a few sentences about yourself, the subject you want to create courses on, and a short demo screencast (so that we can get to know your voice and tone).

We're also paying some content creators upfront to create courses for us, so that we can launch these courses for free. If you're interested in getting paid to create a free Scrimba course, please let us know!
