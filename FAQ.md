## What is Scrimba?
Scrimba is a platform for creating *truly interactive* coding screencasts. A Scrimba screencast might look like a normal video at first sight, however it's something much better. As a viewer you can pause the screencasts and edit the code whenever you want.

## What are the benefits over normal videos?

Scrimba makes life *easier* for the creators and make the learning experience *better* for the viewer. Here are the specific benefits it has over normal videos:

- Much easier creation process
- Interactive (edit/copy/run the code inside the screencast)
- Better mobile experience (we adjust the content according to the screen size)
- Light weight (1% of video in bytes)
- Indexable content

## How do I create a Scrimba screencast?
Check [this Medium post](https://medium.com/scrimba/how-to-create-a-scrimba-screencast-e5ca244bc531) for detailed instructions.

## Can I edit a recording after I've created it?
Not yet (we're working on this feature). However, you can record your screencast in chapters. When you're doing a recording, and hit *Finish*, it'll be saved as a chapter. You can then add a next chapter by doing a new recording. If you mess up during a recording, simply hit *Cancel*, and we'll discard the recording.

## Which languages does Scrimba support?
At the moment, we only support client side code, meaning HTML, CSS, JavaScript (including external scripts/libraries) and Imba.

## How do I add external JavaScript libraries?
Once you've created a new cast, click the *settings* icon in the top right corner, and you'll see a menu for adding external scripts.

## Can I create playlists?
Yes! On your profile, click *Playlists* and then *New*. Once created, you can add screencasts to it.

## Can I add a new topic page?
Topic pages are added manually by the team. But we're very open for suggestions! If you have a suggestion for a new topic, send us an email (hello@scrimba.com) or let us know in the [chat](https://gitter.im/scrimba_community/Lobby?utm_source=share-link&utm_medium=link&utm_campaign=share-link).

## Can I create paid courses on Scrimba?
Not yet, but you will in the future.

## Can I embed Scrimba screencasts?
Yes! Once you've created a screencast, hit the settings icon below the player. There you'll find the embed code. Here's a [live example](http://davekiss.com/using-es6-sets-to-create-a-unique-javascript-array-without-duplicates/) of how an ebmedded Scrimba looks like.

## Why are you building Scrimba?
Our goal is to make online learning *better* than in-person learning. Here's why this is important:

As education has moved from in-person to online, the *in-person learning experience* has been reduced to a video with a comment field. This is a **big step backwards** for both the teacher and the student. 

Scrimba aims to re-create the *in-person learning experience* online, and even surpass it. This will ensure that everybody can get the same high quality learning experience you get through an in-person teacher.

We're starting with programming, and will move to other subjects when we're ready for it.
